# Epinions.com social network analysis

The objective of this project is to analyse the who-trust-whom network among the members of the Epinions.com website. This consumer review site is a shopping search engine that helps compare products, prices and stores online. The members of the site can decide whether to trust each other and the interaction between all these trust relationships forms the "Web of trust". This web of trust is combined with review ratings to determine which reviews are shown to which user. 

The analysis tells us which members are the most influential and trusted most in the network. The analysis includes various centrality measures and clustering algorithms.

NOTE : The network does not reveal any names of members and instead each of them are referred to using a unique number.
